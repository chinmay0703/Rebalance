    "Dry needling is a targeted physiotherapy technique that uses thin needles to treat muscle knots and chronic pain. It's highly effective in releasing myofascial trigger points and improving mobility.",
    "This therapy is ideal for conditions like back pain, neck stiffness, shoulder tightness, and sports-related injuries. Unlike acupuncture, dry needling is based on modern anatomy and muscle physiology.",
    "By stimulating affected muscles, dry needling increases blood flow, reduces inflammation, and speeds up healing.",
    "Experienced physiotherapists combine dry needling with manual therapy or kinesiology taping to deliver faster, long-lasting pain relief and enhanced movement."
